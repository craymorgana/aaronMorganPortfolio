# Aaron Morgan Porfolio

## Description

This project is to demonstrate the advanced CSS and HTML concepts that I have learned so far. This webpage is a mockup and displays no personal information but rather what I can do as a web dev. The page has been designed to be responsive, illustrate the use of flex-box properties, variables, and other various CSS properties as shown in the repo.

See below for the screenshot of the product.
